# 🤖 AI-Powered Stock Prediction Feature

## ✨ New Feature Added: Predictive Stock Analysis

Your website now includes a **unique AI-powered prediction system** that analyzes news sentiment to forecast stock price movements!

---

## 🎯 What Makes This Different

Unlike other stock websites that only show historical data, your platform now offers:
- **News Sentiment Analysis** - AI analyzes headlines and summaries
- **7-Day Price Predictions** - Future price forecasting
- **Confidence Scores** - Shows prediction reliability
- **Interactive Prediction Charts** - Visual forecast display
- **Market Sentiment Indicators** - Bullish, Bearish, or Neutral

---

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. News Collection
- Fetches last 7 days of company-specific news
- Analyzes headlines and article summaries
- Tracks volume of news coverage

### 2. Sentiment Analysis
The AI scans for **positive** and **negative** keywords:

**Positive Keywords:**
- growth, profit, surge, gains, rally, bullish
- strong, beat, upgrade, success, positive
- record, high, breakthrough, innovation

**Negative Keywords:**
- loss, decline, drop, crash, bearish, weak
- miss, downgrade, concern, negative, fall
- warning, risk, debt, lawsuit

### 3. Prediction Algorithm
```
Sentiment Score = (Positive mentions - Negative mentions) / Total articles
Predicted Change = (Sentiment × 5%) + (News Volume × 2%)
Target Price = Current Price × (1 + Predicted Change)
```

### 4. Confidence Calculation
- Higher sentiment = Higher confidence
- More news coverage = Better prediction
- Confidence decreases for longer timeframes (Day 1: 90%, Day 7: 30%)
